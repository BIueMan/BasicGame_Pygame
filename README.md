This code was written in order to learn to code in python. Classes, Inheritance and whole the basis of python.
The game engine was built from scratch using the pygame library. including physics, collision and timeloop mekanik, in a 2D space.
The game coded inspired by another game with the same time loop mechanics. but again, was built from scratch.

## Game Play
By pressing 'R', the main character can loop beck it time. and create a duplicate that mimic every move the main character die in the previous loop.
Which turn the mechanics into a puzzle game. you can see you "echo" marked with it own number on it face, will the main character have a normal, randomly drawn face.

you can a play a slow down version of the game, on the web (like below). or download the Python fils and play on the PC.
